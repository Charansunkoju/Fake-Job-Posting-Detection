# Fake Job Posting Detection

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, online job postings have become a vital resource for those searching for employment opportunities. However, the alarming surge in deceptive job listings has created a challenging environment for job seekers, making it harder than ever to differentiate between genuine opportunities and fraudulent schemes. This project aspires to create a sophisticated Fake Job Posting Detection System. By leveraging the power of Python, Excel, SQL, and advanced Machine Learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Model, we aim to develop an innovative solution that accurately classifies job postings as either legitimate or fraudulent. Through this initiative, we hope to empower job seekers by enhancing their ability to navigate the online job market safely and effectively.


## Project Objectives

- Detect fraudulent job postings to protect job seekers from scams.
- Provide statistical insights into the characteristics of these fraudulent postings.
- Develop a machine learning model to classify job postings based on structured and textual features.
- Enhance the credibility of job portals by flagging suspicious postings.
