# Fake-Job-Posting-Detection

In todayâ€™s digital world, online job postings have become a primary source for job seekers. However, the rise of fraudulent job postings has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between legitimate and fake opportunities. This project aims to develop a Fake Job Posting Detection System using Python, Excel, SQL, and Machine Learning (Random Forest Model) to classify job postings as real or fraudulent.
